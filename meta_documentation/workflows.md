JSON or raw Python as the schema?


types.md.

Everything is a progressive inheritance of detail.

field standard specifies "a step that quantifies", protocol specifies "*the step* agreed on, that quantifies", the lab protocol specifies the specific instanciation - the beaker used, etc.

each is compared to the one above

each one of these has layers of oversight?


if you repeat an experiment based on a protocol, you can click a button to create all the sub items?

SymPy equation

install()

creates virtualhost and/or chroot

use docker for sandbox rather than RestrictedPython

Adding a lesson learned.
Lesson Learned is part of the hargrave standard library. it inherits time entered and time observed from some base class.
The lessons learned fields have Rationales that refer to NASA
calls an on_create hook that populates time entered and observed with current date and time. 
Time observed has a "confidence" field in strength and days; this has a Factors Affecting field with a blurb beneath that says: why do you think this is the time

The lesson learned is visible both in the report for microwave spectrometer (objects with that project identifier sorted by time), and 

Control S must save.
