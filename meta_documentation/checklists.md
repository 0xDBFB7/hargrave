Human Factors of Flight-Deck Checklists: The Normal Checklist
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/adegani/Flight-Deck_Checklists.pdf

> Another objective of an effective checklist design, often overlooked, is the promotion of a positive “attitude” toward the use of this procedure. the checklist must be well grounded within the “present day” operational environment, and the operator must have a sound realization of its importance instead of regarding it as a nuisance task (Nagano, 1975).

> FAR 25.1322 which prescribes color coding for warning, caution, and advisory lights in the cockpit. For example, one major manufacturer uses the color green to indicate accomplished items while the other manufacturer uses the same color to indicate non-accomplished
items.

>  Others will argue that since the checklist is a redundant task,
only the critical and most important items should be presented on the checklist. This statement leads
to another controversy—which items are critical and important enough to be registered on the
checklist. An example would be the “shoulder harness” check. Some argue that this is a critical item
that should be listed on the checklist. Others hold that the chances of an accident propagating
directly from such an omission are very slim, that the use of the shoulder harness is second nature to
the pilot, and therefore there is no need to include this non-critical item on the checklist.


> The checklist is constantly changed and modified, making it a dynamic procedure. However, in
some cases its unique role in the operation of the aircraft is incorrectly used: it becomes a “dumping
site,” to resolve discipline problems, and/or to show management and regulating officials that a
specific problem is settled. By placing these type of item(s) on the checklist, immediate problems
may be resolved, but the importance attached to the procedure by the pilots is reduced, leading to
additional and possibly even more severe problems.
