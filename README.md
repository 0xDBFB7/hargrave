The Scientist's Scrapbook

- Prompt-based, rich, structured note taking.

Interdisiplinary; physical and experimental sciences, computational, but not clinical.

Science, with Texture and Culture!


Is it possible to make an electronic lab notebook that intrinsically makes the user a better scientist?

The first difficulty is to get a thing that will fly at all. When this is made, a full description should be published as an aid to others.

[Lawrence Hargrave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Hargrave)'s occasionally-exaggerated contributions to powered flight are well summarized in *Lawrence Hargrave: Myth and Fact in Aeronautical History*. bears his name because he kept [meticulous notes](https://collection.maas.museum/object/325754#&gid=1&pid=1) He was, of course, flawed.

- A wiki. a great option.

Not making the same mistake twice, or not, requires getting the right information from a vague idea 

- Whitequark's lab notebook
- eLabFTW
     elabftw's API is awesome.
- a google doc.
     one problem is that you tend to just append to the bottom 
     no sense of the certainty of a fact,
    old information is not replaced

> Different people prepare for quals in different ways. One of my labmates prepared by writing hand-written notes in many small notebooks and then scanning them. Another labmate made a handful of slides per paper. For me, I decided to write blog posts on each paper. This approach worked well for me because it forced me to digest each paper by writing a summary, and then to critically think about each paper by writing a “takeaways” section. For some of the papers, I even wrote a quick demo in the Jupyter notebook to help me understand the model or algorithm better.


- Notational Velocity.

search should also include some kind of "category" or "semantic". for instance, I just wanted to note the
following sentence:

"One interesting change is to git help. We now list commands, grouped by the situation 
in which you would want to use them. This came from discussion on usability, 
inspired by one of the talks at GitMerge conference we had in spring."
()

I think that's pretty clever. Now, when I want to write a cli help in the future,
I want to be able to see what I thought was clever for some fuzzy collection involving "help",
without remembering 
Should also be a cross-project search. should also include software output logs
Notational Velocity might do this sometimes...
