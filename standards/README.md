A standard

The hirarchy goes:

- field [society]
- field standard [defines the creation of experiment standards]
- experiment standard
- experiment [instance]

Experiment is a member of a Project.

(submit your Review standards to the project, gets filtered through the mailing list, then 
integrated into a consensus?)
